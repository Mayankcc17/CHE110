    <div class="para">Biodiversity is the variation among living organisms
            from different sources including terrestrial, marine and desert ecosystems,
            and the ecological complexes of which they are a part.

  <!-- Levels of Biodiversity -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Levels of Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>There are the following three different types of biodiversity:</p>

        <div class="content">
          <h3 id = "gb">Genetic Biodiversity</h3>
          <p>Variations among the genes of the same species. 
            It is this type of diversity that gives rise to the 
            different varieties of cat, mangoes, dogs etc.

          <p>Diversity which arises due to variations among species present in specific areas.
            Horses and donkeys are distinct species, as are lions and tigers.</p>

          <p>Ecosystem diversity is the diversity of
             habitats which include the different life forms within.
             The term also refers to the variety of ecosystems found within a
              biogeographical political boundary.</p>

    <h2>Values of biodiversity</h2>
    <p>It's easy to start a campaign or support an existing one. Just follow these simple steps:</p>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="./assets/silk.jpg" >
        <div class="content">
          <h3>Productive Value</h3>
          <p>Different products are obtained from different organisms, like silk from silk-worm, wool from sheep, fir of many animals,
            lac from lac insects etc.</p>
         
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="./assets/hands-in-soil.jpg" >
        <div class="content scr">
          <h3>Ecological Services</h3>
          <p>It refers to the services provided by ecosystems like prevention of soil erosion, prevention of floods, maintenance of soil fertility,
             cycling of nutrients, fixation of nitrogen, cycling of water, their role as carbon sinks, pollutant absorption and reduction of the threat of global warming etc.<br>
             <br>Biodiversity have enormous potential and a decline in biodiversity will lead to huge economic, ecological and socio-cultural losses.</p>

          <h3>Survival</h3>
          <p>Food: A large number of wild plants are consumed by human beings as food.<br>
            Fuel: The  fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are also products of fossilized biodiversity.</p>

          <h3>Ethical and Aesthetic Value</h3>
          <p>Many of the plants are considered holy and sacred in our country like Tulsi, Peepal etc.<br>
            <br>The ethical value means that we may or may not use a species but knowing the very fact that this species exists in nature gives us pleasure.<br>
            <br>People from far and wide spend a lot of time and money to visit wilderness areas where they can enjoy the aesthetic value of biodiversity and this type of tourism is now known as eco-tourism.<br>

  <!-- Biodiversity Conservation -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Biodiversity Conservation Programs Going on in India</h2>
    <p>India is a signatory to several major international conventions relating to conservation
      and management of wildlife. Some of these are Convention on Biological Diversity,
      Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
      (CITES), Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals etc.
      Financial and Technical assistance is provided to State/Union Territory Governments for
      protection and Management of Protected Areas as well as other forests under various
      Centrally Sponsored Schemes.</p>

          <p>India is one among the 17 mega-diverse countries of the world. But many plants and
            animals are facing the threat of extinction. To protect the critically endangered and
            other threatened animal and plant species, Government of India has adopted many
